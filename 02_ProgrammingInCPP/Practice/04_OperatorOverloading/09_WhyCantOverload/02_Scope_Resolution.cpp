1. :: (Scope Resolution Operator)
================================

-: Why it can't be overloaded:
-: The scope resolution operator (::) is used to specify a namespace or class scope.
    The compiler must determine the scope of an identifier at compile-time,
    so allowing overloading would break this behavior.

/*
If we could overload ::, it would introduce ambiguity in name resolution, making compilation impossible.
